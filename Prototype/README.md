<h2 align="center">Prototype "Home" view page</h2>
<p>The Home view has a nav bar at the top that will display the user's name and a logout button. The user's information is on the right, and a button on the bottom will let the user update his/her data. On the left, next to create a workout, there is a button that will create a workout plan, and there is a drop-down button that will select the current workout or previous ones.

<h2 align="center">Update to Prototype "Workout" view page April 7 2021</h2>

<p>I merged the workout page and the home page. Now you can select three different workouts powerlifting, bodybuilding, power-building. In the Nav bar on the drop-down button called Current workouts is where you can find your current and past workouts.</p>
