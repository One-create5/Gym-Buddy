### Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)
A web app that helps users achieve their fitness goals. This program helps the user get stronger (Powerlifting), improve their physic (Bodybuilding), or improve both (power-building). I started with the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) which helped me develop my Wireframe. I used my Wireframe and user stories to create my Views.

### lessons learned:
* what did you do right? </br>
Kept the scope of my project small. 
My project views are simple and clean.
* what did you do wrong? </br>
 I did not take the time to develop a well-structured database schema.

* where were you lucky? </br>
Scaffolding helped out a lot. 
* what would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"? </br>
I would have developed a better database schema.
